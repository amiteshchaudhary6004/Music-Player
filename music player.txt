Music Player Full Description

A music player in Python is a program that allows users to play audio files from their computer.
It can be built using various libraries and modules, with the most common ones being Tkinter, Pygame, and Mutagen.

Core Features:
• Play: Plays selected audio files (e.g., MP3, WAV, etc).
• Pause: Pauses the currently playing track.
• Stop: Stops the playback.
• Next/Previous: Skips to the next or previous track in a playlist.
• Volume Control: Adjusts the volume level.
• Playlist Management: Create, load, save, and edit playlists.
• Seek Bar: Allows the user to navigate within a track.
• Display: Shows track information (title, artist, album, etc).

Libraries and Modules:
• Tkinter: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) of the music player, including buttons, sliders, and text fields.
• Pygame: Handles audio playback, including loading and playing audio files, as well as controlling volume and other playback settings.
• Mutagen: Extracts metadata (e.g., title, artist, album) from audio files to display on the player.
• Implementation Steps: 
    • GUI Development (Tkinter): 
        • Create the main window and arrange GUI elements (buttons, labels, etc).
        • Implement event handling for user interactions (button clicks, slider movements).

Audio Playback (Pygame):
• Initialize the Pygame mixer module.
• Load audio files using the pygame.mixer.music.load function.
• Use pygame.mixer.music.play, pause, unpause, stop, etc. for playback control.
• Implement volume control using pygame.mixer.music.set_volume.

Playlist Management:
• Use data structures (lists, dictionaries) to store playlist information.
• Implement functions to add, remove, and reorder tracks in the playlist.

Metadata Extraction (Mutagen):
• Use Mutagen to read metadata from audio files.
• Display relevant metadata on the music player interface.
